## Bayesian State Space Approaches for Analyzing NFL Moneylines

### Motivation

* I love the NFL, but my favorite team, the Minnesota Vikings, does ***not*** love me. Year in and year out, the Vikings underperform, so I have to find other, healthier ways for staying close to the league. 
* In 2022, I completed my MS in statistics at the University of Minnesota. To do so, I had the opportunity to propose a new approach to modeling NFL moneylines. In addition to typical covariates informing a moneyline, my addition to the research was **conceiving of NFL moneyline updates as realizations of an underlying, unobservable state-space process.**
